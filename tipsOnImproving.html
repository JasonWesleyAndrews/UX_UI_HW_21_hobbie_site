<h3>Tips on Practice and Improving:</h3>
<p>Improve your climbing by just climbing!
    Well the first and most obvious thing to do is to just climb. Climb lots. The more you climb the better. Climb with really good people where possible and watch how they tackle problems. Listen to their advice and learn from their mistakes as well as their triumphs. But also climb with those who are not as good as you.
    
    Climb lots of easy climbs really well. This will lengthen your climbing sessions by not getting pumped out (fatigued arms) and will give you the energy to implement some new moves and techniques.
    
    Tip: Don’t get tempted into spending hours strength training. Further down the line this will have its merits, but you don’t need to be strong to be good. Sure it helps when you start pushing the grades but you will gain much more by practicing good technique and, just climbing.
    <br><br>
    Stand up and use your legs!
    It’s one of the first things we are told as novice climbers… use your legs! It’s also one of the first things we fail to do properly.
    
    Most newbies will instinctively reach up with their arms and expect to have the strength and endurance to defy gravity without a second thought for what their legs can offer to the effort. This poses two problems, amongst others. Firstly, if you are totally outstretched from foot to finger, there is no scope for moving anywhere, least of all up! Secondly, if you do manage to somehow make a move, the smaller, weaker muscles in the body will fatigue quickly and be unable to tackle the next move.
